# Hi, I'm Yuva :wave:
After graduating with my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I decided to apply my education towards starting my first job in quality analysis.It is an e-learning app product based company that I worked,- managed the queries in production team. Soonly After I came to USA for my masters education in Computer science wher i leaned a vast about deep learning, computer vision, data mining, AWS, and programming languages like python and c++. My final project is on pretrained BERT Model and Contrastive Learning: Enhancing Twitter Sentiment Analyis.Ready for a new adventure, I am currently looking for work as a Data Engineer so that I can put my logic and data-driven skills to use in a new environment. When I am not coding, I enjoy spending my time participating in spinning class, Dancing, and playing Badminton.
