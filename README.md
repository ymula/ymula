# Hi, I'm Yuva :wave:
After graduating with my Bachelorâ€™s degree, I decided to apply my education towards starting my own design business. Over the years it grew to include an online shop -- managed and designed by myself -- which had an increase in sales of over 300% in one year. Ready for a new adventure, I am currently looking for work as a Software Engineer with a focus in web development so that I can put my logic and data-driven skills to use in a new environment. When I am not coding, I enjoy spending my time participating in TTRPGs, spinning yarn from wool, knitting, and playing video games.

## :woman_technologist: About Me:


- :smiley: Pronouns: she/her
- :yarn: In my past career as a pattern designer, I focused on creating accessible patterns and shared what I learned with other designers. I also focused on making patterns affordable and size-inclusive.
- ðŸŒ±  I'm currently learning the MERN stack with 100Devs.
- :movie_camera: I enjoy creating free content for fellow learners.
